Shopify Technical Challange Submission Write Up

We were given the task of creating three games using JavaScript. The games were:
 - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock (RPSLS),
 - Tick Tack Toe, and
 - Casino Craps
Completing these three games provided me with a better understanding of how to approach a given problem. First, I needed to identify the core elements that are needed for each game, then I needed to consider the different ways I could implement these elements into my code, and finally I needed to write the code and test whether the games worked properly. 

My process to tackling these games was to first research how they were played. I was familiar with Tic Tac Toe, so I focused my research on RPSLS and Casino Craps. My primary focus for this research was determining what the win conditions were, and specifically with Casino Craps, what were the lose conditions. Once I had figured out this information, I moved on to how I could implement these rules into a functional game. I needed to determine whether IF statements, loops, or Switch statements would be more appropriate for each of the functions that were needed. Once I had written that part of the code, I needed to add user interactions and code that would change images based on the user interaction. These steps were straight-forward, although with RPSLS there were some difficulties changing the board to only display the results in the original design, so there were a few iterations needed. The only iterations needed for Tic Tac Toe and Casino Craps were cleaning up the code, and minor bug fixes that resulted from cleaning the code.

The solution for each of these games is that they function properly, according to the rules of each game, and for the games that track user wins and losses, the scoreboards update accordingly. These solutions are by no means the only solution to each problem, as there are many ways each of these games can be written. 

The major challenges that I had with these problems was ensuring the game boards updated appropriately while the user plays the game. I learned various ways on how to update the game boards, such changing the visibility of certain elements and ensuring certain elements only appear in certain conditions. The biggest challenge I had was learning how to use an array to create the game of Tick Tac Toe. I learned how to update the array when the user interacts with the board, as well as develop a continuous check to see whether there is a winner or loser on each click. If I had more time to do this assignment, I would probably spend a lot more time reducing the number of lines of code in the RPSLS game as I could write it a lot better now that I have more experience with JavaScript. I would probably also spend more time on the scoreboard element that I added. It was not a requirement for the assignment, but I wanted challenge myself and see if I could properly track the userâ€™s wins and losses. It would also be the game that I would probably want the most feedback on, but I am always open to constructive criticism on any of projects, as I want to learn how I can improve.

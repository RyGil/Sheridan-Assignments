The goal of these projects was to teach us mostly Javascript programming. PHP was taught in the last two weeks of class, and assignments 6 & 8 were completed in the last week of class.

We were instructed to include our Javascript in the same file as our HTML for submission purposes.

Game-Site-and-3-Games: Contains the main pages created for the website, as well as the 3 games that were created for this semester (using Javascript)
Game-Site-and-Modifications: Contains the conversion of two of the games from Javascript to PHP, as well as the creation of the Registration page
Game-Site-Final: Contains the files needed to communicate with the database, as well as the conversion of the registration page and ability to login/logout

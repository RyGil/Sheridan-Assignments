## Project Overview
Course: Interactive User Design

Institution: Sheridan College

Project goal: Create an application

This project was a group assignment. Our team of 4 was tasked with creating an app concept that by the end of the semester we would develop (in the form of wireframes). The project was divided into six parts that would be completed over the course of the semester.

## Project Breakdown
1. App Concept (report)
  - Contianed a rationale for the app
  - Listed who the stakeholders were
  - Technological assumptions and limitations of the project scope
  - What the current market looks like for an app like this (do apps like this exist? How similar are they?)

2. User Requirements (report)
  - Developed an online survey to determine user needs (functionality, design, features of the app)
  - An analysis of the results - calculated weighted sum and normalized data based on the likert scale results.
    - This data was used for ranking the importance of features/functionality/design choices
    - It was also used to add/remove features based on open-ended questions
  - The development of user scenarios

3. Initial Wireframe Development
  - Developed the main page for the application
  - Developed a few secondary states/pages/panels for the main page

4. User Testing (report)
  - Developed more wireframe pages for our application
  - Created a script that would be used for user testing
    - Included an introduction
    - the goals/scenarios the user would need to complete, and
    - the tasks/steps for the user to complete each scenario (kept secret from user)
  - The results of the user testing
    - Included difficulty for user to complete scenarios (likert scale)
    - Any verbal comments made by user while completing scenarios
    - Tester observations
    - User's answers to open ended questions

5. Wireframe redesign (report)
  - Redesigned the wireframes based on the user testing results
  - A summary of changes made to the wireframes (design choices, techniques, etc.)
  - A summary of changes made to the overall application (structure, labels, element locations, etc.)

6. Final Report
  - An overall summary of the application
  - How certain course modules applied to our application
  - A conclusion:
    - Summarizing the changes made to the application 
    - What surprises there were during development
    - Things that could have been improved

## My Role
My role as project lead was:
  - Delegate tasks to my group members
  - Ensure that deadlines were met
  - Our wireframes and reports were professional
